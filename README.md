This package is transpiled and polyfilled to be pre-ES6 compatible which means it 
works on all modern browsers
## Install

You can either [download](https://github.com/StenAL/favicon-marquee/archive/master.zip)
the whole project or install it via npm or yarn:

```
$ npm install favicon-marquee
$ yarn add canvas-marquee
```

## Usage
favicon-marquee can be bundled with all major build tools or imported from
 a file

```
import FaviconMarquee from "favicon-marquee";
// or
import FaviconMarquee from "path/to/lib/main.js";
```

Now that FaviconMarquee is accessible, you can use it by running the following code
```
const marquee = new FaviconMarquee({
    text: 'easy!",
    font: '"Comic Sans MS", sans-serif',
});
marquee.start();
```
This will start the marquee in your current tab with the text `easy!`

FaviconMarquee can be customized by passing the following the properties
 to its constructor, although sensible defaults are provided:
 
`text` - text to be displayed in the favicon. This can be any unicode character 
including emojis, cyrillic, hangul, etc.  
`font` - font of the text. This can be any valid CSS `font-family` value  
`color` - color of the text to be displayed. Can be any valid CSS `color` value  
`background` - color of the marquee's background. Transparent by default. Can be
any valid CSS `color` value  
`step` - specifies how many pixels the marquee scrolls each render. This can be used
to speed up or slow down the text  
`size` - size of the canvas used to render the marquee's text. A larger size results in
a more detailed picture but might cause performance issues  
`marginBottom` - the text rendered is displayed at the bottom of the favicon. This
can optionally be used to add some margin to the bottom to center the text instead  

These properties must be wrapped in an object before passing them to the constructor.

Additionally, a number can be passed into the `start` to control how often (in ms) the 
marquee is re-rendered.

```
const marquee = new FaviconMarquee({
    text: 'Different text ðŸš€',
    color: '#323330',
    size: 48,
    step: 0.5,
    background: "#F0DB4F",
    marginBottom: 3,
});
marquee.start(1000/30); // renders at 30 fps
```
